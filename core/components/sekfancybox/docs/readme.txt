Snippet: SEKFancyBox
------------------------
Version: 0.0.2
Since: February 7, 2012

Added jQuery load option with a system setting, sekfancybox.load_jquery, 
that will load jQuery onto any page sekFancyBox is called. There is 
also an option, &loadjquery, that will override the system setting. 
This will prevent sekFancyBox from conflicts with other extras that 
load jQuery.

Thanks,
